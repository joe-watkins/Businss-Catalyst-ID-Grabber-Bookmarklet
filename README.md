Business Catalyst ID Grabber - Bookmarklet

Using this little bookmarklet you can easily grab ID's from within the Business Catalyst admin interface. Generally this is a little tough and requires one to 'mouse over' items or even grab ID's from the url bar from your browser.

Simply copy the javascript bookmarklet to a bookmark within your web browser and once inside the Business Catalyst interface click the bookmarklet to expose IDs.

## Currently this supports:

- Page Templates
- Content Holders
- Menus
- Secure Zones
- Site Search
- Web Apps
-- Web App Items (20 or less)
- Photo Galleries
- News
- Media Downloads
- FAQs
- Categories
- Workflows

## Usage

Open up the bc-id-grabber-bookmarklet.js file and create a bogus bookmark in your web browser's bookmark bar and the click edit. You will paste the javascript into the url for that bookmark.
