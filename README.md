Business Catalyst ID Grabber - Bookmarklet

Using this little bookmarklet you can easily grab ID's from within the Business Catalyst admin interface. Generally this is a little tough and requires one to 'mouse over' items or even grab ID's from the url bar from your browser.

Simply copy the javascript bookmarklet to a bookmark within your web browser and once inside the Business Catalyst interface click the bookmarklet to expose IDs.
